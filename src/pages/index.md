  title: Why Renesans
  description: >
    Renesans is the paints store for everyone who believes that great paints
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  Renesans is the ultimate spot for paint lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take paint production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        We sell green and roasted paint beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of paint beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about paint roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good paint has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow paint lovers and learn about
        paint making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our paint to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the paint's
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
